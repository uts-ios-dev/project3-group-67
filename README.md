A card flipping game that can enhance children's memory and improve their vocabulary effectively. 

The game uses a understandable and intuitive way to interact with potential low age users. 

Two modes (simple and normal) will appeal to kids with varying memory abilities. 

Players need to remember the pictures on the cards within 5 secs and then flip each pair of them with same images accordingly. 

Pictures contain everyday words describing common animal and plant life. We consider them as Australian farmyard features so we named the app Happy Farm. 

Thank you for downloading our game and have a nice time playing!
